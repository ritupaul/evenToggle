# evenToggle

A Mathematics tutoring web application for kids has a button that highlights all even numbers, using 'yellow' as the background color. Clicking the button again removes the background. All further clicks add or remove the 'yellow' background alternately.

Currently, the button doesn't work as expected. For the given HTML markup and JavaScript function, determine what the issue is and fix the bug accordingly. You may copy the code into VSCode and run it in your browser if you want to.
